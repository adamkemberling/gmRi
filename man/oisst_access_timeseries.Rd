\description{
Tool for accessing oisst regional timeseries from Box.
Regionally masked timeseries have been pre-processed and stored on box. Quick access
is available here.

This function is used primarily as a pass-through function for oisst_access_timeseries(),
which relies on it to look-up file paths.

Simply specify your personal path to the oisst_mainstays folder,
the group of polygons your area is in, and the name of the region itself.
